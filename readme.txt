Server test:
/src/server/DefaultSocketServer.java

Client Test:
/src/client/DefaultSocketClient.java

To test, I opened two instances of eclipse and loaded the same project directory
Then ran the client in one and the server in the other.

Sometimes the server and client will go out of sync since there can only be one response for each request,
but occasionally there may be an extra response from some error
