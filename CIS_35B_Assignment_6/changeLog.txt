Change Log for the KBB project
Assignment 2:
a. Instructor Comments: keep in mind OptionSet is not meant to be an inner class of Option. 
	Before lab 4 make sure these classes are refactored to have no inner classes.
b. Score: 16/20 (4 points taken off)
c. Changes:
	/src/model/Automobile.java
	OptionSet is an inner class of automobile and Option is an inner class of OptionSet
	Automobile class contains an instance of OptionSet and respective Options
	/src/adapter/ProxyAutomobile.java
	Increased readability, documentation, and code efficiency.
d. Test Cases:
	/src/driver/Driver.java
	test driver
e. I request the full 4 points back

Assignment 4:
a. Instructor Comments: I don't see test output that shows how your code tests synch and non synch ops.
	Where is synchronization implemented?
b. Score: 12/20 (8 points taken off)
c. Changes:
	/src/model/Automobile.java
	synchronization is implemented in the automobile class methods
	/src/scale/EditOptions.java
	synchronization in runSynchronous() method
	/src/adapter/ProxyAutomobile.java
	synchronization operation split into operationSynchronous() method to make it more clear
d. Test Cases:
	/src/driver/SynchronousDriver.java
	test driver for synchronous operations
	/src/driver/AsynchronousDriver.java
	test driver for asynchronous operations
	each operation runs in its own thread. Occassionally an exception will be thrown because some option set name
	was changed and was tried to be accessed by another thread. The stack trace is intentional!
e. I request the full 8 points back
